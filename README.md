# My weather app (react js)
 
_Available Scripts_

This project is basically a **responsive** **weather** **app** in React JS, I used the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather data. I have used react hooks and modern JavaScript to build this application.In this project directory, you can run:

1. **npm start** :
This would run the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

2. **npm test** :
It Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

3. **npm run build** :
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
You can refer https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/ for more information.
